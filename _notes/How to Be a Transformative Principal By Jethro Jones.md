If you've been listening to [Transformative Principal](https://transformativeprincipal.org) for any amount of time, you know that I ask this question every interview!

Well, guess what? You now know so many things you can do to be a transformative principal.

But how do you put this knowledge into action? How2Be is a coaching program to help you master the essentials to become a transformative principal!

We focus on the following 9 skills:

## Self-care

The fallacious idea that you should take care of yourself so you have enough in the tank to take care of others is one of the worst lies in education. Take care of yourself because YOU matter.

## Support for them, Support for you

Support doesn’t always mean what you think it does. We’ll talk about how to have difficult conversations, how to understand your staff better, and how to help them be the best they can. In order to support others, you have to have support yourself. This program is a good start!

## Delegation

We usually speak of strengths and delegation in terms of tasks. We need to start thinking in terms of people.

## Vision

At the end of the calendar year, but in the middle of the school year, we address the vision. Is your school achieving your vision, or is it taking the path of least resistance?

## Observations

Observations are not for evaluation! The evaluation is a nice way to summarize your observations. Observations are for measuring how well your vision is implemented.

## Communication

Communication is not just about you speaking to others. It’s a two-way street, fraught with potholes, car accidents, and detours.

## Relationships

Relationships can make or break a school. You’ll learn how to build good, strong, healthy relationships and how to maintain them, even through difficult conversations. You can’t force anyone to do anything, you can only invite.

## Hiring

It’s never too early to talk about hiring. The earlier you have a plan, the better.

## Culture

Culture is the foundation of everything in a school, but there is so much to it, it can be overwhelming. We’ll talk about how to make it work with small steps that make a difference.
