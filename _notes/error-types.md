title: Testing the null hypothesis type I and type II errors
---

## Null hypothesis

We define the null hypothesis as the statement that we would like to test.

In this example, we want to predict the presence of spiders given the grain size. Hence, the null hypothesis consists in that the grain size is independent of the presence of spiders

To test that, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is performed.

$$
D = -2 \log{ \frac{L(H_0)}{L(H_1)} }
$$




## Type I errors

The null hypothesis was true but it was rejected.

## Type II errors

The null hypothesis was false but it was accepted.
