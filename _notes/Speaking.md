# Presentations & Speaking

Sharing what I learn is very important to me. Here you will find links and resources from all my presentations. I am available for speaking engagements on any of the topics below: 

-   How to be a Transformative Principal
    -   With the leading podcast for educational administrators, Jethro Jones has interviewed over 300 leaders to find the keys to being transformative. This presentation includes insight from the greatest msteainds of our generation [seen here](http://transformativeprincipal.transistor.fm).
-   It's not Just Fixed vs. Growth
    -   Based on the work of Ryan Gottfredson's Success Mindsets. Understanding the four mindsets (fixed vs. growth, closed vs. open, prevention vs. promotion, inward vs. outward) is a key to transforming your school culture. Learn about interventions to create positive mindsets that can change your school's identity. 
-   SchoolX - Creating a school experience to help every child succeed. 
    -   There are many things we can do to make our schools better, and most of them don't cost any money. Learn how to use the design thinking process to help you make better decisions so that those who come to your school walk know that it is designed for them. 
-   Student-led 20% Genius Hour Edcamps Synergy Passion Project Time.
    -   There are a lot of buzzwords out there about giving kids more choice and voice in their education. This presentation demystifies those phrases and helps leaders put into place a game plan for meeting the needs of each student in their building. 
-   Trauma-informed practices for schools 
    -   In this practical for schools presentation, I speak to the need for trauma-informed practices for edcuators. I teach educators how to ask questions first, and how to have frank conversations without feeling uncomfortable, and how to see students (and staff) as individuals first, meeting their needs individually in a systematic way.
-   Using Personality Styles for Effective Communication
    -   At the root of all problems in schools, we usually find communication (or lack thereof) as a major culprit. In this presentation, I walk leaders and teachers through how to use personality styles to manage staff and students so that the communication is effective and the school can thrive. 
-   Effective School-Community Communication
    -   How much should we communicate with our community? How do we help teachers communicate effectively? What is the best way for our staff to invite community members into our school? 
-   Keeping Kids Safe on Social Media (one geared towards parents and one geared towards educators)
    -   In this presentation, I speak to the need for staying safe and how parents and educators can support children to make good choices, how to deal with failure, and how to stand up for others. 
-   Student Driven Learning
    -   This multi-day workshop is geared towards moving whole systems to a student-driven learning model.
