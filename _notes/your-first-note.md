This is your first note.

To link to another note, use regular Markdown syntax for links, with a relative link to the other note, like this: [this is a link to a note about cats](/cats).

You can also use Roam-style link syntax by wrapping a note's title in double brackets, like this: [[A note about cats]]. If the Roam-style link does not point to a valid note's title, the double brackets will still be shown, like this: [[This note does not exist]].

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

You can display images using Markdown's image tag, like this:

![]({{page.image}})
