## Highlights
###### ID 234676342

> 1. Set up a proper writing space
> Gary was a big fan of writing anywhere.
> • His desk
> • Local bar
> • Bookstore
> • Coffee shop
> The location didn't matter.
> But he made sure to stick with the same one for long stretches.
> The goal was to signal to his brain "it's time to write." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816285270052868))

> 2. Set up a writing routine
> “I write when I’m inspired, so I see to it I’m inspired every morning at nine o’clock.” ~ Peter De Vries
> Time: the first thing you need to write well. 
> But the best writers don't find time to write. They make time to write.

###### ID 234676345
> Gary was big on writing first thing in the morning. 
> So before bed, he would scribble down notes on four questions: 
> • What's the big idea here?
> • What's my product's biggest benefit?
> • What's most exciting about this product?
> • What emotion am I trying to create. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816295139352583))
    
###### ID 234676346
> Then, he went to bed and let his subconscious do the work for him. 
> Like clockwork, he would wake up with a clear answer to each question.
> And then, time and time again, he would write a legendary sales letter that would generate millions in revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816297223888898))
    
###### ID 234676347
> 3. Write. A LOT. 
> Gary says there's no shortcut. And he's right.
> The more you write, and the more often you right, the better you will become. 
> Because no one has 100 bad pieces of writing. 
> They either have 10 and quit, or do it long enough to figure it out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816299312594954))
    
###### ID 234676348
> 4. Write for set time periods.
> Gary was big on the Pomodoro technique.
> He set a timer for 33:33. 
> And his rule was simple: he could do anything he wanted during that 33:33.
> Except get out of his chair. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816305683730435))
    
###### ID 234676349
> And this took the pressure off writing.
> Most times he'd stare at the wall for the first few minutes. Sip his coffee. Think about how many other things he'd rather be doing.
> But then, someway or another, he'd start writing.
> And the timer let him know the torture would end soon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816308187836419))
    
###### ID 234676350
> During his breaks, he would walk around, have a quick snack, and do anything else but write. And during this time, inspiration always struck. 
> Then, at the end of the day, he wouldn't say to himself "I wrote until I got tired."
> He would say "I wrote for six sessions today." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816310536609793))
    
###### ID 234676351
> 5. Write something easy, first.
> When Gary wasn't feeling it, he would practice copywork.
> He had a go-to list of great sales letters he would copy word for word to get warmed up.
> I didn't believe this would work at first. 
> But it's now my go-to way to get the juices flowing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816317952172035))
    
###### ID 234676352
> 6. Allow yourself to create junk.
> For every great sales letter, Gary wrote 20 crappy sales letters. 
> His reminder: "In this history of written communication, nothing has ever been published that is 100% perfect."
> And @JamesClear has a similar rule:

###### ID 234676353
> 7. Write your first draft fast and furious with no editing. 
> When writing, rip out your backspace button. 
> When editing, but it back and rip out everything else. 
> Every piece of great writing started as a crappy piece of writing.
> So just get started. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1419816325573226510))
    
###### ID 234676354
> 9. Create an idea capture system
> Gary's system was epic: back in the day, if you wanted to capture an idea on the go, you an 866 number.
> That number would record his call for 60 seconds, then email him a transcription. 
> Now, we have better tools:

> 10. Specialize in something
> Writers that go nowhere:
> They try to be everything for everyone on every platform, all the time. 
> You need constraints. 
> • Time
> • Topic
> • Length
> • Medium
> • Platform
> • Cadence
> Here's how to leverage them:

###### ID 234676356
> 11. Reward yourself
> Humans are simple dopamine chasers. 
> But amateur writers get dopamine from notifications. 
> Professional writers get it from hitting publish.
> The easiest way to do this? 
> Print out a giant calendar.
> And make a big red X every day you write and publish.
