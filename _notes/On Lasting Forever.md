A thing has happened too many times for me to count. 

1. I sign up for a great service on the internet, 
2. other people like it, too,
3. so they sign up also.
4. It gets big and either
5. becomes a cesspool OR gets bought by another company (sometimes both) and then
6. it gets shut down. 

One service I used was called [Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous). It was lovely. 

Well, I just learned today that Garry Tan and Brett Gibson created a new blogging platform called [Posthaven](https://posthaven.com/pledge), designed to last for the next 100 years. That's pretty cool. It's like what [37Signals](https://37signals.com/policies/until-the-end-of-the-internet/)- they'll keep supporting it until the end of the internet. 

Have a Good Life.
