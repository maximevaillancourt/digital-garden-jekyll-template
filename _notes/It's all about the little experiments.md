We had a great time at the Big Impact Mixer yesterday. You can join us, you know. Just go [here](https://bigimpactmixer.com). 

[Brian Pulliam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briankpulliam/) was our main event and he shared his story of going from making a salary of over 600K as a software engineer lead to working 3-4 hours per day, and that is it! He shared a little bit about why he took this transition, and how rewarding it has been. 

- Brian shared his career journey through roles at Microsoft, Zillow, and Coinbase before transitioning to a coaching career.
- Emphasized the need for a **low-risk transition**, especially considering his family's financial stability.
- Discussed the concept of **'leap of faith' assumptions** and how they can derail goals if not verified. 
- Brian compared **personal goal achievement** to running a startup, using **scientific experimentation** like A/B testing to optimize outcomes.
- Shared details about his **coaching method**: focused on teaching tactics, allowing clients to run their own experiments.

I shared the three things that I learned in Japan at the beginning of this month
1. Think long term
2. Be intentional
3. Design for the user
