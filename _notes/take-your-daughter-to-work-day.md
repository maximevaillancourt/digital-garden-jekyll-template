I took my daughter with me to work today for "Take Your Daughter to Work Day". She is 4 and loves preschool and can't wait to go to Kindergarten.  
  
She had a great time at work with me and loved the attention she got from the students and loved being with big kids. She did really well, and we even got to ride the bus in the afternoon.  
  
What really amazed me was how the other students interacted with her. Being the Assistant Principal, I get to deal with a lot of kids who struggle in various ways. Those kids were exceptional when they were around her, without fail. It was fascinating to see how they changed when she was there. I really enjoyed seeing how they were kind to her, compassionate and very friendly. One fifth grader even got her set up on a web site where she could play games. He took great care to make sure that she was on a game that was appropriate for her. I was really proud of my "other" kids for treating my kid so well.  
  
I don't know exactly why they were so good to her, but they were, and it really made me remember that they are great little people that I get to work with every day.
