Over 11 hours saved in just a few months of use. ![Time saved in a few months](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lpflukf0m8x728j/TextExpander%20saved%20time.png?token_hash=AAGvC_ZlajupTjRFI8O_eXJjkwADbkf_KtLLoc05xss7kQ&dl=1)

Hazel Rules to Download:
------------------------

These are some of my rules that you can download for yourself. I am not sure how well they will download for you, as the movement of files is particular to your computer. I'll change their color where I would move them, and you can change that to work for you. If you have problems, shoot me an [email](mailto:jethro@paperlessprincipal.com).

[Sort into Subfolders](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nyfoyjelthcfj8b/sort%20into%20subfolders.hazelrules?token_hash=AAFuQtHAt4eFWUMDdRacMpDMaxa_4pQNFJraAAKiJdCYpQ&dl=1): This is the best rule that I currently use. It is based on filenames, and adapted from a web site that is no longer with us.
