title: Github and Git
---
Github and Git are a powerful combination for version control and code sharing. This note is intended to be an informal table of contents for the notes I have on this blog regarding Git and Github.

### What exactly is Git?
Git is a version control system that has been widely adopted by programmers across industries. It is a "stream of screenshots"[^1] of each file in your project. This enables us to do many useful things, such as to revert changes, collaborate with ease, and create branches to keep our codebase organized.

### What exactly is Github?
Github is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.
