Hello, dear reader, and welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm from Wisconsin but I've been moving around the US from the Midwest to the South and from the West coast to East coast. Currently I'm in Durham, NC.

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 2021. Currently, I work on cloud transformation solutions for a global marketing firm. My professional experience also includes an internship that I completed in 2020, which was related to process engineering.

It's my hope that you can find something interesting and/or useful on this site. Feel free to drop me a message <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejaynew/" class="external-link">on Linkedin</a> if you have feedback or questions.

Thanks for stopping by!
