It's time! Our next Big Impact Mixer will be on Thursday at 10 am Pacific.

We're going to have two interesting presentations Thursday!

**First**, get there on time, because Brian is going to tell us all **why he took an 84% pay cut** to do what he's doing now.

Can you even imagine taking an 84% pay cut at the height of your career?

What would that look like for you? If you make a million dollars a year, you'd be left with 260K.

But what if you make 260K? You'd be down to 39K!

But what if you make 80K?

You'd be down to $1000/month.

What would make that kind of pay reduction worth it?

What would have to be true for you to make that kind of decision?

**Second**, I'm going to share 3 lessons I learned from my time in Tokyo last month. It was truly amazing, and wonderful.

I'll share how I learned to think long term, be intentional and put the user first.

**Third**, we are going to finish out with some breakouts and networking to talk about those things we learned from Brian and yours truly. 

Finally, I ended last month's Mixer with a request: **Invite someone to this month's mixer**.

You can invite them by sending them to [https://bigimpactmixer.com](https://bigimpactmixer.com/)

## Housekeeping

**Calendar invites** You should have a calendar invite for this week's mixer already on your calendar. If you don't, please let me know and I'll add you to the calendar invite! Reminder, decline the events you can't make, but leave future events on your calendar, so we can stay connected.

**Chat** Our chat space is at chat.bigimpactmixer.com - that's a place where we can continue the conversation, make deeper connections, and find partners in whatever your big impact is! If you aren't signed in there, yet, please [register here](https://chat.bigimpactmixer.com/join/aw0m-8m7Z-ZPVJ).

PS. Who is this Jethro guy and why is he hosting this event?

I have been podcasting since 2008, in various forms. Since then, I have created the longest running, most downloaded school leadership podcast out there, Transformative Principal.

Now, I help other people who are mission driven by coaching them or helping them to create their own podcasts and connect with the right people in the right way to build powerful communities where people take action.

If you want to talk about how a podcast can help you make a big impact, [please reach out](mailto:jethro@transformativeprincipal.com).
