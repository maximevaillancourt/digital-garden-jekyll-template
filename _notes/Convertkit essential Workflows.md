On Wednesday at 6:10 am, @Converkit  CEO @Nathanbarry just released some amazing news that you can now have 10,000 subscribers for free-Perfect Plan for Podcasters

I've sent over 1M emails with Convertkit and most of them are automated. 

My Evergreen Share System is the best way to take advantage of their new plan as a beginning podcaster

It has just four simple steps: 
1. Create a form with a good freebie related to your podcast audience.
2. Create a visual automation that enrolls everyone in your Evergreen Share Sequence. 
3. Create a tip jar in Convertkit to help people support you. (or create a product you can sell)
4. When you release a good podcast, add it as an email to that sequence. 

Let's dissect this a little more. 

Create the form in convertkit. This form will be placed on your episode pages, and will invite people to download your freebie/lead magnet and help you build your email list. In your email delivering that, share that they're going to get your greatest hits, too. 

Create a sequence called "Greatest Hits". If you're a beginning podcaster, you don't have any greatest hits, yet. That's OK. You can share your favorite podcast episodes by other people. 

In the first email in the sequence, write that every few days they'll get one of your best podcast episodes. The first one starts tomorrow. 

For the next email in the sequence, share a podcast. There are two keys to this email. 
1. Share what you find valuable from the podcast episode. 
2. Ask them to share their thoughts on it. 

At the end of this second email, ask them to support you by one of these options:
1. signing up for your product, 
2. adding to your tip jar, or
3. forwarding your email to one of their friends.

Repeat these keys for every email in the sequence. 

When people are in a sequence, whenever you add a new email, they'll move forward in the sequence, and they'll get that email, so you can continue adding to it. But, here's the fulcrum, new subscribers will get all the emails in a row. 

You can continually add to your Greatest Hits sequence, and eventually have a 10-12+ week email sequence that shares your best content with them on a regular basis. This is incredibly powerful at building rapport, sharing your best stuff, and helping them know how they can help you. 

A couple more pro tips: 

First, edit your template to include some basic info like 
1. "Subscribe to the podcast" links, 
2. "Forwarded by a friend? Subscribe here" links
3. "Here's how you can help" links

Second, don't worry about it being perfect, worry about providing value.  You can always edit the sequence later for the next subscribers.
