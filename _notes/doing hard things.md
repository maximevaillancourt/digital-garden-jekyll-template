Do you ever do new, hard things? 

Of course you do. But how many of the new, hard things are of your own choosing? 

How much are you putting yourself outside of your comfort zone, intentionally? 

You learn things about yourself when you do hard things. 

I read this quote in a book recently. ![[IMG_8536.png]]

> “When you get fit, it will look like grit.” That is, if you help someone find a good fit, they are more likely to display the characteristics of grit—like sticking with something—even if they didn’t before. ([Location 4370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H1ZYWTM&location=4370))

That is from the book, "[Range](https://amzn.to/3TIH9KE)" which is about generalists being successful in a specialized world. 

You see, we sometimes get put in situations where we don't have all the skills we need, yet. Sometimes, we can also put ourselves in those situations. 

I mentioned a couple weeks ago that I achieved something recently that I gave up on 10 years ago. It just blows my mind!

Imagine how much I would have learned had I had grit 10 years ago to stick with that! 

Imagine how much money I would have saved if I had gone that route! 

This is what is so fascinating to me right now. 

So, what does that mean for you? 

You have an amazing opportunity right now, today, to learn and do something that is difficult. 

You have the great opportunity today to put yourself in a challenging situation where you can show your grit. 

Do you have any idea how much stuff I do?

This little "web" is not even everything I'm involved in, either. I intentionally didn't include the business entities that I'm involved in. 

So, why all this navelgazing? 

Two reasons: 

1. It's good to be reflective and take stock in what we are spending our time on, and
2. I can feel that I'm going through a transition period right now and it's really fascinating. 

Rather than just go through it, I want to document a few things and get them out there for myself and for others to see as well. 

As I've gone through life, I've been very goal-focused and oriented. 

Here's my major problem with that: I get no satisfaction from completing the goal. Once I've achieved it, I'm bored and ready to move on to the next thing. So, why do it? 

The joy is in the journey, but that's a cliche platitude, right? 

What I'm learning is that I actually really like having a focus and a goal and shifting my energies to that thing. 

So, if you've read this far, you're reading for a reason right? 

**Question: What is the value you get from me?**

Seriously, I want your response. Shoot me an [email](mailto:jethro@transformativeprincipal.com) or text! What is the value that you get from reading my blog? What is the value you get from my podcasts? Why are you reading this? 

P.S. Also, I'm procrastinating on some schoolwork for my doctorate. More on that another time. 🤣
