Spike Cook:


>I’ve been to countless presentations, meetings, and conferences. No matter how many presentations I see, I am always amazed when the presenter delivers their message without considering the learning process.



I'm going to a couple conferences in the next couple weeks. I feel the same way as Dr. Cook. On the other hand, it is pretty brutal presenting to a bunch of educators, as they are often the most difficult crowds.


Dr. Cook lists some good ideas to help you on your next presentation. Implementing some of them will make the educator audience a lot less frustrated.
