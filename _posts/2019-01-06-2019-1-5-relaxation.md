This may have been the most relaxing winter break I’ve ever had. I totally turned off work, and only did the things I wanted to do.

I played lots of card games with my family, and enjoyed every minute of it.

I’m excited for a good 2019 and feel recharged and ready to tackle the second half of the school year.
