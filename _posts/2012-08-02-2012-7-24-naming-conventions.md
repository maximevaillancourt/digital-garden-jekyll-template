---In 
[the book,](http://paperlessprincipal.com/preorder) I talk about naming conventions. There are three rules that I adopted from David Sparks' 
[Paperless](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/paperless/id520393162?mt=11). ​

*Assume people will change positions (so be descriptive). 


*Always use lowercase​.


*Date always goes first.​

Here is my list of naming conventions, so you have an idea of what they look like. ​

I use TextExpander to rename files often. It inserts the current date, and is always lowercase, and it makes things very easy. ​TextExpander makes it super easy to be consistent, which is vital when it comes to going paperless.
