Karen Wang:


>Over the years, many helpful and compassionate comments have stuck with me.  Here is a sample of supportive comments that have been spoken to me as a parent, but I should note that I also make it a point to express my appreciation to the team as well.  IEP support isn’t just a 2-way street:  it’s a busy construction site with administrators, educators, parents and the student all interacting and choosing to build the future together.



Some great tips for school personnel. It is so easy to think of IEP meetings as meetings with just a goal to get it over with, but we have to remember these are people's children and we need to act respectfully and compassionately. I need that reminder just as much as anyone else.
