The school I just finished the year at is not that technology advanced. They do have some technology (some that I didn't know about until the last day) but it is not that great. The computers that I hunted down for my room were <a href="http://support.apple.com/specs/emac/eMac.html">eMacs 700MHz</a>, running Mac OSX 10.2. They were very slow and many times did not work how they were supposed to. I did have a <a href="http://education.smarttech.com/ste/en-US/">SMARTboard</a> in my room, but I never had time to learn how to use it, so I didn't use it. I did try a couple times, but it was more difficult than I wanted. As I have mentioned before, my 9th grade honors class did individual blogs each week. That was a neat experience, but I have a different plan for next year. I want to have a blog for each class, and then each class will have one day to go down to the lab and do their blog. It will be very important for me to teach them that this is not just some other assignment. I need to incorporate research, good writing skills, correct grammar usage, and internet safety. If I don't include these things, it will be virtually worthless because they will just be doing an assignment, and not effectively using technology to better their experience. I have decided to use a class blog because it was very difficult for grading and tracking to see who did their assignment when every one of them had its own url. At my new school they have <a href="http://www.kintronics.com/Plus/DP-60.html">opaque projectors</a> which are basically overhead projectors that you don't need transparencies for. They are really slick. You can put the student's paper in there, right after they wrote it and then critique it and give them immediate feedback. There are <a href="http://www.kintronics.com/Samsung/presenters.html">video projectors</a> on the same site since opaque projectors are discontinued but we had those at BYU-Idaho. I didn't think they were that great.<br /><br />Changes I need to make regarding technology next year:<br /><ul><li>Use technology effectively to enhance education, not just to use it for the sake of using it.<br /></li><li>Use technology to make my job easier, not harder.<br /></li></ul>
