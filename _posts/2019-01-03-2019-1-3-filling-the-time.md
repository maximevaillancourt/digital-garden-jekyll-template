As any other normal human being, I am often plagued with self-doubt.

It's super annoying.

But, we all struggle with it. In a recent podcast interview, 
[Seth Godin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-moment-with-brian-koppelman/id814550071?mt=2#) shared that he also struggles with this. I figure if he can admit it, so can I.

One of my goals this year is to build a thriving side hustle in just 2 hours per day (with a couple sprints for big projects). I work on my 
[Transformative Principal Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/transformative-principal/id770942472?mt=2), 
[Transformative Leadership Summit](http://transformativeleadershipsummit.com), 
[Transformative Mastermind](http://transformativeprincipal.org/mastermind), 
[speaking engagements](http://jethrojones.com/speaking), and my forthcoming book.

In my self-doubt, as I often do, I considered abandoning a bunch of projects.

A text from a listener made me realize that I am making an impact.

>I steal most, if not all, strategies, from guys like you! Never underestimate your impact.  You and others like you are part of mental wellness for administrators!


That's very kind.

One of my constant thoughts is, what if I do stop doing all this, what would I fill the time with?

Knowing myself, I would take on some other project. Would I have the impact I desire through some other project? Why throw away all my hard work over the last five years for something entirely different? Would that be worth it? Is my 5 years of work really that meaningful?

So, here's what I am going to do: I'm going to tell my self-doubt to shut up! And I'm going to keep making awesome content for principals who want to do things differently.

I want you to join me. How do you join me?

You can 
[schedule a short call](http://calendly.com/jethro-jones/15min) with me and tell me how I can serve you better.

Seriously, what are you waiting for?
