Heather Sommerville >SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Last December, seventh-grader Shubham Banerjee asked his parents how people who are blind read.
A Silicon Valley tech professional, dad Neil Banerjee told his son to “Google it.”


>So Shubham did, and with a few Internet searches he learned about Braille, the tactile writing system used by those who are blind, and Braille printers, which, to the 12-year-old’s shock, cost thousands of dollars. One school science fair victory, a few national accolades, $35,000 of his parents’ savings and a visit to the White House later, Shubham today is the founder of Palo Alto startup Braigo Labs, which aims to become the first purveyor of low-cost, compact Braille printers.



So, this is pretty amazing. Stories like this are always quite inspiring.
