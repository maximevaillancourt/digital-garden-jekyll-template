John Robinson:


>Sociology researchers Daniel McFarland, James Moody, David Diehl, Jeffrey Smith, and Reuben Thomas recently published their findings regarding “Network Ecology and Adolescent Social Structure” in the American Sociological Review. Without getting too deep in the details of this study, or getting tangled in their terminology, it turns out that there might be things about our schools that contribute to the development of these cliques. (See Edmund Andrews excellent summary of this study’s findings “
[Stanford Research Explores Why Cliques Thrive in Some High Schools More Than Others](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/november/cliques-high-school-110514.html)."



Maybe I should be a sociologist in my next life. It seems like lots of fun to learn about how people act and why.
