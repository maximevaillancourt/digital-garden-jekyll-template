We all do it, even when we know it is wrong. We assume that we know why people are acting a certain way.

We spend time, energy, and effort on trying to know why people act the way they do.

And more often than not, our assumptions are negative.

It’s not worth it.

People act how they act. They have their own motivations.

What if we assumed they were doing the very best they could do each day?

What if we assumed that they had good intentions instead of seeing the worst in them?

What if we just didn’t assume anything?
