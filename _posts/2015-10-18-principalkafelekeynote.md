---I've heard of 
[Principal Kafele](http://principalkafele.com) before, and it was really amazing to hear him speak today. He spoke to a room full of principals and other leaders in Alaska. Very inspiring and moving words.

#Principal Kafele


Critical leadership questions for inspiring school wide excellence

*You're a principal and you better let someone know you're interested in that so they can put you there!


*If they just gave me a chance I would light those kids on fire.


*My claim to fame as a leader is the motto for this conference "Passionate Present Principal"


*What does your signature look like, as it relates to your capacity to lead a school? What is that thing that you do that makes you great?


*You can only dream about what you can perceive in your circle. Need to help kids expand their circles.


*Speak life into the emotionally dead, so kids can see what they can become.


*My attitude changed everything.


*I am the number 1 determinant of the success or failure of my students.


*Kids need to hear from their principal before they leave.


*How often do we engage in self-reflection?


*Three questions:
*Who are you?


*What are you about?


*What is your most recent evidence?


*To these boys, I want to be a man.


*Motivate and empower students. Empower, can I now apply my motivation?


*As it relates to your staff's perception:
*Are you the school's 
instructional leader?


*Are you the school's 
informational leader?


*Are you the school's 
inspirational leader?


*Called an assembly to tell students what he does as an instructional leader


*Don't let kids end up doing jobs that have nothing to do with their potential!


*Why do I lead and what drives my decision making?
*We are building a school where we are excellent on purpose!


*Do I lead with a definite purpose which drives everything I saw and do?


*Do I aim to be intentional about what I do as a leader?


*Do I treat my leadership not as a job, profession, or career, but as a mission?


*Do we recite our mission? If you are in the building, I expect you to know the mission!


*You have to take care of you as a leader!
