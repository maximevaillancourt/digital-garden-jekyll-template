[Seth's Blog: The dominant narrative](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/03/the-dominant-narrative.html)


>We come up with a story (about an organization, a person, a situation) and all the data that supports it, we notice, and the nuance we discount or ignore.
  So, if you believe that Whole Foods is expensive, you won't notice the items that are a little cheaper, but the overpriced things that confirm your narrative will be obvious.
  If you believe that your boss is cold-hearted, you'll gloss over the helpful moments and remind yourself of the other times.



These are storylines. It is so important that we, as leaders, are able to define ways for our teachers, students, and parents to approach us when they have a storyline and get the story straight.
