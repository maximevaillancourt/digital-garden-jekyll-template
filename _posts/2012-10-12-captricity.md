---Do you ever have kids turn in forms that you wish were done online because they are going to end up in an Excel spreadsheet somewhere? 

​Captricity is a tool that will do that for you. (And if you want to follow a blog that does a great job explaining how to go paperless, 
[DocumentSnap](http://www.documentsnap.com/) is a great one.)​
