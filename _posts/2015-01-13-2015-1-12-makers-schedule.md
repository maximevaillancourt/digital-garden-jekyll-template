Paul Graham:


>When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no problem for someone on the manager's schedule. There's always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.



Two things:


*Now I understand why I struggle so much when doing creative work. I do my best work when I schedule about 4 hours to do something creative, which is nearly impossible right now.


*The nagging problem with doing a makerspace at school or establishing our school as a place that is focused on kids being makers is that we don't have enough time blocks to devote to that type of pursuit. We follow the manager's schedule in school and force kids to move every 45 minutes on to the next process that likely has no relation to the thing they were just in.
