David Sparks:


>I've been reading the reports of the massive data loss at Sony over the last few weeks. In some ways, the most jarring reports are not leaked finances but instead all the email. As much of a geek as I am (or perhaps because I'm a geek), I just don't share private thoughts via email or text message. This came up on a recent episode of Mac Power Users and I truly believe people don't understand how easy it is for governments, or subpoena-wielding attorneys, or … now … motivated hackers to get access to digital communications and records.



I've been thinking a lot about this lately as well. Just don't send things you wouldn't be happy with other people knowing about.
