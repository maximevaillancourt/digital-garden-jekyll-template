I don’t have enough time to exercise.

I’m not good enough to meet my goals.

I’m not good enough for X.

It’s natural to feel not good enough. The power comes in changing your limiting beliefs to Liberating Truths.

I have all the time I need to be healthy.

I’m good enough to meet the goals that are important to me.

I’m good enough.
