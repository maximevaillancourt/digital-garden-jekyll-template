George Couros:


>What if every teacher tweeted one thing a day that they did in their classroom to a school hashtag, and they took five minutes out of their day to read each other’s tweets?  What impact would that have on learning and school culture?



Seems like a pretty simple thing. Would probably do well to quell the tide of negativity towards public schools. Our school's hashtag is #KodiakMS.
