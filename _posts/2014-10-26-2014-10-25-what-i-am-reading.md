I'm taking a hint from Melinda Miller and sharing what I am reading right now.


Journey to the Veil - A spiritual journey of a man whose blog I read and later met who passed away a couple years ago from cancer. Powerful, moving.


How Buildings Learn - A recommendation from my assistant principal. So far I love how the author speaks as if buildings are alive and make choices.


The Art & Science of Teaching - A book about teaching by Marzano, on which our evaluation system is based.
