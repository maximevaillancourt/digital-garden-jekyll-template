Jimmy Casas:


>Yet here I stood in a room full of people trying to navigate the emotional sentiments of some of our parents that I could attribute back to a lack on my part to communicate effectively.  That’s on me.  It wasn't that I underestimated the fallout that I knew that would occur from my decision and maybe that is what eventually led to my failure to communicate information out in a timely manner, somehow subconsciously leading myself to believe that it would not matter. Yes, it was a hectic week and I was trying to navigate what seemed like a bizzilion things that were coming my way, but quite frankly, people don’t want to hear excuses, especially from a leader who prides himself on owning his mistakes.  So I did the only thing I could do in that moment. I apologized.
