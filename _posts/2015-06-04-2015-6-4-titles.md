Doug Timm:


>I also want to be told I am wrong. I want to be challenged, and questioned! It might hurt in the moment, but guess what, I will get over it.  I will sleep on it.  I will talk to my most trusted circle about it.  That is healthy discourse.  I will come back and realize that learning WITH is exactly what just happened.  A light bulb just went off, we learn collaboratively, just like we ask of our students! Share, listen, think, talk, repeat!



Communication is so key.


I don't really get involved in the title discussion, because the title is the least important part. People know who you are by how you act.
