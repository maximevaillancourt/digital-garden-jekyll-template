William D. Parker:


>In this 
[cheat-sheet of the proposed bill by Alyson Klein](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2015/01/sen_alexanders_draft_nclb_bill.html), you can see that the recommended changes would reduce the number of high stakes tests as well as reduce the entitlements schools receive.



I'd love to see a reduction in testing. We should constantly be assessing our kids, but a reduction in high stakes testing is a great place to start some changes.
