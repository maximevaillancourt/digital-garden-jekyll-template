George Couros:


>…although I am extremely interested in the medium, I am trying to stop trying to “edufy” every social media site I see.  The appeal for social media in many cases was to have fun and sometimes I think that it is easy for myself to lose that initial idea and appeal that drew me to things like Facebook in the first place.



I can certainly get on board with the not edufying every social media site. Vine is about watching funny short videos for me. I don't want that to be about education stuff.
