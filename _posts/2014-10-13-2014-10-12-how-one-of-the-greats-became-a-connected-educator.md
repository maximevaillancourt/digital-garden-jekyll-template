Eric Sheninger describes what his school looked like before he became a connected educator:


>Each monotonous day began with students arriving to school and then going directly to their first period class where they sat in desks arranged orderly rows.  After listening to the daily announcements the delivery of instruction began. My compliant students then went through their rigid eight period day schedule with each class lasting forty-eight minutes. At the end of each class an annoying bell would notify everyone in the school that it was time to continue through the repetitive process.



If you feel this describes your school, now may be a good time to connect yourself to a global group of educators looking to make education better in every way possible. I've got a 
[good list]() to start with.
