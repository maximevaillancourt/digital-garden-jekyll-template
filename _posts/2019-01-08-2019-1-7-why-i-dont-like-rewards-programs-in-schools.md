I finally figured out how to articulate this:

I don't like rewards programs in schools because they reward compliance, not excellence.

There are exceptions to that rule, but if that is your goal, to get kids to behave better (to be compliant), I'm not a fan.

If you can get kids to strive for excellence through your rewards program, that's great.
