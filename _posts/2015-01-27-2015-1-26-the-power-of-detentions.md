Sam LeDeaux:


>How would we want student behavior impacted as a result? I’ve seen teachers stumped in silence when asked this question. In the heat of the moment, sometimes we become egocentric. What we “want” is for students to be punished as a result of their behavior toward us. When we find ourselves here, I suggest re-routing our focus. It is challenging to prescribe resolutions for students when we are focused on ourselves. Do we want increased student responsibility? Respect for the learning environment? Compassion for our community? It is imperative that as educators and professionals we prescribe student-centered solutions that promote positive behavior moving forward.
