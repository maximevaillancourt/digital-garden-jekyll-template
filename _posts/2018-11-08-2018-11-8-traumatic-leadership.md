I heard someone refer to leadership as being traumatic the other day. I haven't really thought about it as being traumatic, but as I've pondered it since, I have thought of some situations where it is traumatic.

I'm curious about your thoughts. Do you have exmaples? Leave them in the comments below or send me a private message.
