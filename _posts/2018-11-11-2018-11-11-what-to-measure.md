If expectations without consequences is wishful thinking, then we get exactly what we ask when our expectations aren't followed.

You know what I hate? Tracking and following up on all the little things that everyone is supposed to be doing.

I hate that because I have a lot of other things that seem more important than hounding teachers for not doing their attendance every day.

Sometimes, however, I feel that my teachers need me to hold them accountable so they can hold the students accountable.

The question I still don't know the answer to is what needs to be measured to get actual results?
