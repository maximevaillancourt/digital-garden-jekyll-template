I just received Seth Godin's new book, "This is Marketing."

One concept that he writes about is the idea of the smallest viable audience.

Who are we serving in our schools?

When legislators make absurd laws that cripple educators, who are they serving?

When school boards enact policies that make it more difficult to teach students, who are they serving?

It's time to focus on the people in front of us. In your school each year, it's the students right there in front of you.

Each year, our smallest viable audience is the bodies that walk through our school each day. That's who we should be serving.
