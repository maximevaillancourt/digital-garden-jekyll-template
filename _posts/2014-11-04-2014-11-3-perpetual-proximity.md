David Ginsburg:


>Yet proximity is more than an essential behavior management practice. It's an essential assessment practice. Proximity in this context involves circulating among students throughout class, whether they're working on a five-minute Do Now or a week-long project. Such perpetual proximity allows you to assess and address each student's ongoing needs--academic and behavioral. It also lets you collect data about the class's needs as a whole, and make timely, informed decisions about how to proceed.



Proximity as an assessment practice? Yes, please!
