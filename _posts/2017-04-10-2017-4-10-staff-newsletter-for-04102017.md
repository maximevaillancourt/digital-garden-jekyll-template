Hi Team,


Dr. LeDoux asked me to let you all know that Melissa Haffeman will be recommended to the board tonight as the principal of Kodiak Middle School for next year! Wahoo! Congratulations, Melissa!


**Upcoming Calendar items:**


PEAKS testing this week. We will use our Testing Schedule (

We have a PTA meeting on Wednesday at 5:30.


This Friday is Grade Level PLCs. Damon, Melissa, and I will be meeting with your teams briefly to show you Microsoft Teams.


There is a Friday Night Live this Friday from 7–9 pm.


For 8th graders, KHS counselors will be here next Monday to talk about course offerings at KHS.
