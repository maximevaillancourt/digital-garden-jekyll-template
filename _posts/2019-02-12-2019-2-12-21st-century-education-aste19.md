When I first started teaching, anytime someone said 21st century education they were pretty much talking about technology.

Now that we have technology everywhere, I've learned that technology, big surprise, is not the savior of education we thought it was years ago.

Don't get me wrong, it certainly enables a lot of great things, but as I see kids on technology more and more, I see that we as adults are missing three things that are exceptionally important to our success as a society. We need to have these three things focused on kids:

*Patience


*Trust


*Process

These three keys are existing in pockets around the country. In order for our schools to be successful, these are the three most important attributes for adults to gain.

I'm giving a short keynote on this on Monday at the 
[ASTE conference](http://aste.org) in Anchorage.
