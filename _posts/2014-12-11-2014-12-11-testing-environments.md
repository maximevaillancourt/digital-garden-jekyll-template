The Weird Teacher:


>This entire process, while efficient and cold, is not comforting or creating a relaxing environment. It is not a thinking-positive environment. It's not a place where you should feel comfortable. It's a place where you should feel watched. It's Testing with a capital T. The way It Should Be.
  The goal of this place is a secure Testing Environment. Period.



Doug makes some really great points in this article after explaining taking a test for his certification. I took four such tests in one year's time and it was brutal. It is one thing when your grade is on the line; it is another thing when your job is on the line!
