This week, I am releasing an interview with John and Rachael George, a husband and wife principal power team. While they may currently be in different districts, they have been doing this for years, and have great insight about how to make things happen in schools.

As you can imagine, I loved the part where they talk about systems. They are so important. I encourage you to check out the podcast today and listen to their 3 step process for helping schools.

Because the systems are in place, that allows great things to happen. Have you taken the 
[LifeScore Assessment](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019assessment) yet? With the LifeScore Assessment, you can figure out which part of your life needs work, and then create a system around it to make it even better. 
Let me tell you briefly about one area where that has done wonders for me.

I used to stay up late every Saturday night editing my podcast. It was awful. I started to dread it. After taking the LifeScore Assessment before it was fancy like it is now, I realized that my podcast was dragging me down because of the Saturday night editing session.

Once I figured out the pain point, I created a system to make it happen better. Here's the nerdy system I use:

*Guest schedules in calendly.


*Calendly tells Trello when the schedule is (where I track my system)


*Guest gets an email to fill out address so I can send a thank you card


***Interview happens, I write a thank you card and record intros and outtros if needed, and move the card in Trello**
 - This is the only part of the system I really touch now.


*​My AMAZING editor Željko edits the interview and updates the card in Trello


*My good friend Lydia uploads the podcast to Libsyn.


*Simple Podcast Press automatically publishes the podcast to 
[my web site](http://transformativeprincipal.org)

This system didn't create itself, but sometimes systems do create themselves. I created this system to help me be more successful at what I was creating.

You have a system in your school. It's either good, bad, or ugly, but it is there. You just might not have documented it yet.

The 5 Days to Your Best Year Ever is a system designed to help you "win at work and succeed in life." The 
[LifeScore Assessment](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019assessment) is the first step. Go take it!
