Wow!


I am so fortunate to work with some amazing people. Our awesome assistant principal, 
[Damon Hargraves](http://twitter.com/damonhargraves) arranged for a bunch of our teachers to talk at board meeting tonight and they were incredible. They told our story, the story of the work that we do to help the students of Kodiak Middle School, and they told it beautifully. We weren't asking for anything, we were just explaining who we are.


These teachers jumped out in front and made us look good. They talked about trauma-informed practices, our tutorials, our math intervention practices, our PLCs, our culture. We are a culture of amazing educators that rock! It is an honor to work with them!
