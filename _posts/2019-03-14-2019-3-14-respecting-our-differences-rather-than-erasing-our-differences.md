This year, for spring break, my wife and I are redoing our kitchen.

There are some things that I really want to learn how to do, and will spend hours studying so that I can understand them better. (Technology and leadership.)

Then, there are some things that I can learn, and learn quickly. (How to lay vinyl flooring.)

Then, there are some things where I can understand in principle how to do it, but I cannot ever do it "right." (How to hang cabinets, sew, and tie knots.)

A big part of our education system is broken, and I believe that it is in part broken because of this exact problem that I am learning this week.

Everyone has different skill sets, talents, passions, abilities, life experiences, and dispositions.

Rather than respecting and honoring those differences, we seek to make everyone the same.

We really need to find a way to make respect our differences, rather than erase our differences.
