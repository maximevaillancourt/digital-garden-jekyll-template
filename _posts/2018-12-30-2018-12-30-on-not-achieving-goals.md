I set six major goals in 2018.

I achieved half of them.

In the past, I would be pretty bummed about not achieving them, but with one exception, I did better than I would have otherwise.

One of them was just not a good goal, because I didn't have a real reason for doing it, and I abandoned it in March.

Overall, if I could measure myself from last year to this year, I would be pretty happy with how I did, even if my goals were not all accomplished.

Having perspective really helps me to feel OK about where I landed.

The other thing that really helps is recognizing that it is all my fault that I didn't achieve my goals.

I can't blame that on anyone but me. And I can shoulder that responsibility.
