<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>When it comes to a father-in-law, I really got the cream of the crop. He is such a good man, and I am really lucky to have the opportunity to learn from him. He is extremely patient, doesn't lose his temper, and is always polite and cordial (sometimes he even gets in <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nice+fight" title="Nice Fight" target="_blank">nice fights</a>, a term I "coined" but luckily UrbanDictionary is the true definitive source).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ralph knows how to get people to do what he wants. He is not pushy in the slightest, but he is incredibly wise and you can almost see that wisdom exude whenever he starts to give his experienced opinion. He is such a good salesman because he&nbsp;</p>  <ol>  <li>Is not pushy.</li>  <li>Has a wealth of experience.</li>  <li>Sets you up.</li>  </ol>  <p>When he thinks something should be done a certain way, he tells you. But, he is ever so careful to extremely sincerely say, "Now, I don't want to tell you what to do, but..." From some people, that could come off as "I don't want to tell you what to do, but I am going to anyway, and you better follow it because I am a genius!" That is <em>not</em>&nbsp;how he says it. The way he says it is more like, "You know, my good friend, I'd hate for you think that I see you as anything less than a genius, because I don't. You are so smart, and you probably already know everything I can think of, but I am going to tell you this anyway, mostly to reaffirm for your how intelligent you are..." I am not kidding, that is how he is. The way he introduces his ideas is so humble and stand-offish that the result is truly remarkable: I <em>want</em>&nbsp;to take his advice, at least most of the time.&nbsp;</p>  <p>His ideas are usually based on a great amount of experience. Therefore, they are typically well thought-out, effective, and simple, so it would be a good idea to take them regardless of how they are presented. He doesn't need to be nice about it; he could just say it, and it would still be good advice. But his delivery is so effective that it doesn't even seem like a suggestion for action coming from him.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It is inspiring to see how he operates. He would probably be horribly embarrassed if he saw that the title of this post said salesmanship, as he would likely consider my analysis of him a major insult. That I am even associating his communication style with something as connotatively horrible as "Salesmanship" would no doubt make him blush.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And that is just something else that is good about him.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Have a Good Life.</p></div>
