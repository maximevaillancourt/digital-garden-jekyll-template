Sarah Gietschier-Hartman:


>Could exposure to standards-based grading in school prepare our students for life in the “real world”? If our students have access to an assessment system that is proficiency-based, with clear learning targets and outcomes, will they be more prepared to be evaluated by future employers who use a similar system? Will they have a clearer understanding of what is expected of them?
