Rebecca Elliot:


>It wasn’t a single turning point, but a series of smaller events that led the 42-year-old pediatric dentist to become one of the leading providers for children with special needs in the Houston area. Among the reasons: She watched a friend raise a daughter with autism, an influx of patients with special needs turned up at her office and she was introduced to a program designed to treat patients on the spectrum without restraint or sedation, typical practices in many dental offices.



The dentist is a difficult place for me, and almost torture for my daughter. I'd love to take her someplace where she can learn to calm down and deal with it.
