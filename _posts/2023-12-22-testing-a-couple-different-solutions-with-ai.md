I do cold plunge thoughts every morning and post them to my 
[instagram](https://instagram.com/jethrojones). Well, I'm a podcaster, so I figured I should do a podcast with these thoughts as well.

So I did.

In generating the show notes, I didn't want this to be a time-consuming endeavor, so I'm trying to automate it as best as possible.

First, I upload the video to Google Drive and then it is magically cleaned up using 
[Auphonic](https://auphonic.com), after which it is published to the podcast feed automatically using Zapier and the Transistor.fm API.

The show notes weren't coming out how I like them, so I started using one of my favorite tools, 
[AudioPen](https://audiopen.ai?aff=neRMq), to generate them. I can give it my writing style and it can create shownotes based on that. Powerful.

I also am playing with 
[Castmagic's](https://app.castmagic.io/share/66d9e140-2a49-4eda-86aa-74c8d381dd69?ai_content=true&magic_chat=true) AI tools as well. There's a lot to like out there.

Here's Auphonic's version:

>In this episode, we dive into the transformative journey of self-love and body positivity. Our host shares their personal experience with realizing the importance of loving their body and the subsequent changes that followed. It all began with their decision to prioritize self-love, which they believe is crucial in treating their body with the care and respect it deserves. Over the course of two months, they dedicated themselves to practicing self-affirmation, standing in front of the mirror each day and declaring their love for their body, regardless of its shape or size. This newfound mindset gradually brought about a shift in their perspective and a stronger motivation to make positive changes. Notably, the host's brother-in-law and sister's own weight loss journeys served as additional inspiration. After six months of working with a personal trainer, the host discovered that cultivating a mindset of self-love ultimately formed the foundation for all subsequent transformations. Tune in tomorrow as they reveal the specific steps taken to shed their first 40 pounds.


And here's AudioPen's better results:

>Cold Plunge Musings: Approximately four months after visiting a personal trainer, I began to experience something unexpected – a newfound love for my body. It was intriguing, as I hadn't realized that my previous attitude towards my body had been lacking in affection. Looking back, it became apparent that this disconnect had started years ago.


>I decided that nurturing a love for my body was essential. Surprisingly, the workouts and dietary choices paled in comparison to this realization. It felt odd for a man to admit such a sentiment, but I recognized that loving my body would lead to treating it differently.


>For the following two months, I concentrated on embracing my body, regardless of its shape or size or perceived flaws. Daily affirmations in front of the mirror became routine: "I love my body. This body is wonderful." Gradually, a shift in mindset and motivation emerged.


>Around this time, my brother-in-law and sister were also losing weight, looking better, and feeling more energetic. Inspired by their progress, I resolved to make some changes myself. This decision came after six months of weekly personal training sessions – all leading up to the pivotal moment of choosing to love my body.


>With this foundation in place, everything else followed suit. Tomorrow, I will share how I lost my first 40 pounds.
