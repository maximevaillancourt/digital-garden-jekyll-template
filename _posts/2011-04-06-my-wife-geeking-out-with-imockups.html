<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>So, my wife is a pretty good scrapbooker. She recently was asked to create a scrapbook layout for scrapbooksteals.com, to which a large portion of our paycheck goes each month (just kidding; I am lucky she is wise with what she spends there). I used an app for designing our work web site called <a href="http://www.endloop.ca/imockups/" title="iMockups">iMockups</a>. I told her it might be worthwhile to try using it to create the wireframe for her scrapbook layout. She typically takes my app suggestions and does nothing with them since she likes to be her own person (an admirable quality).</p>  <p>Well, eventually, she bought the app for her iPad and she struggled with it a bit, and then we figured a couple different things out. Below is her scrapbook page layout.</p>  <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-04-06/vnhljBgevDDisDdCaiphoffskspCEiqfCxbjbmEemeDJaeCFoFdkGznJosIz/Week-37.png.scaled1000.png"><img alt="Week-37" height="362" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-04-06/vnhljBgevDDisDdCaiphoffskspCEiqfCxbjbmEemeDJaeCFoFdkGznJosIz/Week-37.png.scaled500.png" width="500" /></a> </div> Since she has made this layout, she made about a dozen more layouts, and then started plotting out what our backyard is going to look like as we add a garden next year. I am fascinated that she took this tool that is expressly designed for mobile apps and web pages, and used it for her own creation. She made it work, and created a lot of really neat layouts. In addition to that, she also helped me understand her vision for our backyard, which is great, since I have to do all the work to get it to that point.</p>  <p>I am constantly impressed by how something like the iPad, which seems so limiting at first (no keyboard, weak processor, small memory, consumption-only device), can actually allow people who aren't really geeks to be <strong>creative</strong> in their own special way. It is inspiring.</p></div>
