I continue to believe that communication is the most powerful agent in any organization.


This video ties in very well with the idea of 
[Storylines](http://www.jethrojones.com/blog/2014/1/18/storylines-or-how-to-deal-with-misunderstandings). So often, we assume things that are not the case. It leads to pain, suffering, and most importantly, misunderstandings. Without these misunderstandings, life would be so much better. If you are not happy with something, talk about it, openly and honestly. It will be worthwhile. If you are not happy with everything, it is you who needs to change.
