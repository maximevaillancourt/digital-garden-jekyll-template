[Graduation & What It Means To “Model With Mathematics” | dy/dan](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/graduation-what-it-means-to-model-with-mathematics/)


>I plotted the first ten names and modeled their times with a linear equation. (“Time v. names read” was my model, though commenter Josh thinks “time v. number of syllables read” would be more accurate.) The calculation for cousin Adarsh’s 157th name is 19 minutes. I would be foolish to rely on that calculation, however.
  
  
Ask your students to “Assume your answer is wrong, that something surprising actually happens. Anticipate that something and fix your mathematical answer.”
  
  
George Box: “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”



As an adult, this is the only math I ever do. Why shouldn't our school math be more like our real math?
