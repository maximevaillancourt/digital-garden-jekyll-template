>“In a similar vein to SMS Relay, you can now answer and make phone calls from your Mac or iPad. When your iPhone receives a phone call and your Mac or iPad is on the same WiFi network, they will also ring and will let you answer the call. The same goes for making calls, which you can initiate from Contacts, Calendar, Messages, or Safari on any of your devices.”



Really great overview of the features of Yosemite and iOS 8. I am so excited for phone relay, I can hardly stand it. My office is a black hole and being able to initiate calls from my computer will be super nice. I have use Google Voice for a long time, so I know how great it can be. I am really excited to never have to use my desk phone again!
