I love Twitter.

[Denise](https://twitter.com/DeniseMurai/status/1082506837008605184) mentioned this 
[TED Talk by Daniel Pink](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation?language=en&utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) about rewards programs.

Career analyst Dan Pink examines the puzzle of motivation, starting with a fact that social scientists know but most managers don't: Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think. Listen for illuminating stories -- and maybe, a way forward.

[Wendy](https://twitter.com/SotoWE1/status/1082615429254823937) mentioned 
[this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/10/05/why-dangling-rewards-in-front-of-students-and-teachers-is-counterproductive/?utm_term=.ac48b515da7f&noredirect=on) by Alfie Kohn about his perspective. Both are great.
