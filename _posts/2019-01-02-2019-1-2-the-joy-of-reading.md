I got a Kindle for my birthday last October. It reminded me how much I enjoy reading.

It’s interesting because I have always been a reader, but the last few years my reading has been online articles mostly.

I’ve read books but haven’t kept track of them very well.

Well, I read 48 books in 2018, that I kept track of, and most of those were in the last couple months of the year.

One thing that helped is being able to check out ebooks from my library. It only gives me 7 days to read them, so I can go through books pretty quickly.

Perhaps the best part is watching my kids learn to love reading as well.
