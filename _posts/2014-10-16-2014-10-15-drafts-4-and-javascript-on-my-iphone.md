>Here's a keyboard script that scratches my lizard brain just right. It takes a list like this:



5. Cat Food
    3. Binoculars
    2. Pebble to suck on
    1. Lefty scissors

This is the kind of stuff that makes me think that maybe I am not nerdy enough for some of the cool things available now on iOS. I don't know how to code, so maybe Drafts is no longer for me.


I do, however want to use my phone in a better way, so maybe it is worth learning (or stealing) some of these things so that I can be better at what I do.
