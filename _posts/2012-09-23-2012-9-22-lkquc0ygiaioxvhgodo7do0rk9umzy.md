If you have tried out Hazel after reading 
[Paperless Principal](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/paperless-principal/id558201943?ls=1), you are awesome. As 
[Chris](http://practicaltheory.org/blog/2012/09/22/the-paperless-principal/) mentioned in his post, there is a learning curve to going paperless, but it is well worth it. One of the things I learned this last week is:


##Order Matters with Hazel Rules



A couple weeks ago, I had to rearrange my rules so that our dedicated computer for paperless would work better for our whole office (and not just me anymore). I had to put the Hazel rules for renaming things in a different folder, and a bunch of the documents that should automatically be renamed to "witness statement" got renamed to a bunch of gibberish.


In the move, I had put the "Rename according to keyword" rule above the "Rename Witness Statement" rule. When I moved the order of the rules, it worked perfectly again.

When you are creating your own Hazel rules, take into consideration what the most common rules you'll need are, and then be mindful that if something isn't working, it could be as simple as a reorder of your Hazel rules.
