We all want our kids to do well in school and focus on school. But sometimes, Trauma makes that nearly impossible.

This is a podcast map.

I've interviewed hundreds of guests, and these are my top 5 podcasts you should listen to if you want to learn about trauma.

They've helped me tremendously on my own journey and helped me figure out how to implement trauma informed practices in my schools.

Children who are dealing with trauma struggle in ways that we don't always understand. These five episodes will help guide you on different aspects of how to deal with trauma in your communities.

###[Strategies to deal with the Coronavirus Trauma with Karen Gross Transformative Principal 346](https://jethrojones.com/podcast/episode346/)


In this episode, Karen is specifically talking about the ways that we can deal with trauma associated with the Coronavirus. Good tips about naming, framing, and taming behaviors.

##2 for 1 special!


###[Safety. Connection. Learning. with Teri Barila Transformative Principal 177](https://www.jethrojones.com/podcast/episode177)


###[Building adult skills to support trauma-impacted youth with Teri Barila Transformative Principal 178](https://jethrojones.com/podcast/episode178/)


Teri Barila was instrumental in the creation of the school featured in 
[Paper Tigers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4076258/), a great film about a school that implemented trauma informed practices. Both of these episodes are awesome introductions about how to support students who have been exposed to trauma. As educators, we always talk about the behavior kids exhibit because it messes up our plans, but Teri invites us to not get hung up on behavior!

###[Behavior as a Lagging Skill with Matthew Portell Transformative Principal 367](https://jethrojones.com/podcast/episode367)


Matthew Portell is the founder of the Trauma Informed Educators Network group on Facebook, and he has talks about behavior as a lagging indicator, which means that behavior is one of the ways that you can measure the effectiveness of strategies that you have implemented.

###[How to combine SEL and Virtual learning with Tamara Fyke Transformative Principal 344](https://jethrojones.com/podcast/episode344)


This interview with Tamara Fyke, founder of 
[Love in a Big World](https://loveinabigworld.org), talked about the balance we need to have between teaching virtually and the need to connect with kids. We need to let go of control and prioritize supporting kids.

###[Behavior Speaks for Itself with Barbara Sorrels Transformative Principal 269](https://jethrojones.com/podcast/episode269/)


[Barbara Sorrels](http://www.drbarbarasorrels.com/) is Executive Director of The Institute for Childhood Education. From this episode we learn that behavior is language. When we say kids don't communicate their challenges, what we really mean is kids don't communicate in a way that we are prepared and ready to understand.

Knowing how to deal with Trauma is important. I invite you to download the 
[whitepaper that I created on Trauma Informed Practices](https://transformative-principal.ck.page/055ea4227e) in schools and let's schedule a time to 
[talk about what you're seeing](http://calendly.com/jethro-jones/let-s-talk-trauma) in your community.
