---[Last post](https://www.jethrojones.com/blog/how-many-teachers-do-i-need-to-hire-for-social-distancing) we talked about all the things you’ve got to think about as you plan for reopening. I totally get it! 

I heard some interesting concerns. Here's a couple: 

*Beverly is worried about her after-school programs


*Rebecca is worried about money! 


*Lots of principals have reported not seeing budgets for 2020-2021 school year yet! 


*A few pointed out they are worried about hiring people and having to let them go when the school year starts. 

Thank you to those who are sharing. So, what are you actually doing with reopening right now?

I’ve heard a few principals are doing some different things...

Some principals have started lengthy plans that include scenarios for every option. This is a tremendous amount of work and something that we won’t ever use, because there’s only going to be one thing that happens. In fact, one principal told me she spent five hours on a plan, only to have it rejected and told to start over because the information changed. 

One principal is so overwhelmed, she can’t even think about it.

Another principal is waiting for the governor to announce something, and then he’ll have to scramble to get it all done in time for school to open.

Many principals have mentioned they don’t even have a budget yet!

Some principals are just waiting for the other shoe to drop, or leaving the planning up to the district. 

Some principals are really focusing their planning on equity and social justice issues, because that actually seems easier than planning for reopening with coronavirus.
