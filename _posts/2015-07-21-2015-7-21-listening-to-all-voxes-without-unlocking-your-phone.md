Twitter Version: this little hack allows you to tap settings, then Members and listen to all your unheard Voxes.


I really like 
[Voxer](https://appsto.re/us/txtFw.i). It is a great app that allows you to communicate with anyone who has the app via voice and text. Sure, there are other ways to do that same thing, but this is a worthwhile different way to connect. I use it mostly for group chats, which can be super overwhelming, especially when you fall behind in your listening. What's worse, if you have a lot to listen to, and your screen locks, you have to unlock it and press a tiny little play button! It is annoying.


Today I stumbled on a fix!


If you are in a group, tap settings (top right) then tap members, and lock your phone, or use another app. Voxer will continue playing all the missed Voxes even though you aren't in the app anymore! This will make my phone dry while walking to work in the rain, and make me drive safer by not having to look at my phone.


As a bonus, I have a better chance of staying up to date!
